## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
<img src="Sample traffic signs data.png" width="480" alt="Sample Traffic Signs" />

Use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I will train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I will then test the model program on new images of traffic signs I find on the web.
